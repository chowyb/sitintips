Website description:
This website is targeted at new NUS SoC students who are taking CS1010 and CS1020.
It is intended to help them with the associated Practical Exams and Sit-In labs for these modules.
The coding.html webpage is lacking some content, but is intended to help show how multiple pages would work in the navigation of the site.


Grading Component Locations:
Usage of a grid system: Mainly used in the navbar of all pages for responsiveness; the actual content always uses 12 columns.
Responsive Design: Slight changes in the navbar to accommodate for smaller width; the actual content is automatically handed by Bootstrap.
Any of the base CSS: Used across all pages. An example is the use of img-responsive in the "General" tab of unix.html.
Any of the components: Navbar (all pages)
Any of the Javascript category items: Tabs (unix.html). coding.html only uses 1 tab.

Form validation: Suggestions box on index.html; js code in main.js
jQuery effects: jQuery show in unix.html, at the bottom of the "Commands" tab; js code in main.js
